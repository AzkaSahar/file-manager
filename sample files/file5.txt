Operating systems have evolved significantly over time, from early batch processing systems to modern multi-user, multi-tasking systems. Early operating systems were primarily designed to manage hardware resources and facilitate the execution of user programs. However, with advancements in computer technology, operating systems have become increasingly sophisticated, offering features such as virtual memory, multiprocessing, and network support.
