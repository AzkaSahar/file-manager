Memory management is an essential aspect of operating systems that involves the regulation and control of computer memory . The primary objective is to allocate separate memory locations to various applications to optimize system performance and to avoid overlapping . Memory management strategies include paging , segmentation , and the use of virtual memory . This allows for the efficient utilization of memory and minimizes delays by ensuring that data is available for processing by the CPU as needed .
